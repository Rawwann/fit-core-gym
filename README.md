# Product Landing Page: FitCore Gym

## üìù Overview

This project is a static landing page for a fictional gym named "FitCore Gym." The page was built using only HTML and CSS, with a primary focus on applying fundamental web design concepts, especially building a layout using `float` and managing element flow with a `clear-fix` utility.

**Goal:** To practice building a complete web page from scratch using traditional layout techniques (Floats) and to gain a practical understanding of the Box Model.

## ‚ú® Page Features

* **Hero Section:** A main showcase for the service with a clear title, description, and Call-to-Action buttons.
* **"Why Choose Us" Section:** A 3-column layout displaying the gym's main advantages (Premium Equipment, Expert Trainers, Flexible Hours).
* **"More Than Just a Gym" Section:** A 2-column layout (image on the left, bullet points on the right) showcasing additional services like group classes and nutrition guidance.
* **Testimonials Section:** Displays customer reviews in a 3-card layout.
* **Stats Bar:** Shows 4 key gym statistics (Members, Trainers, etc.) in a 4-column layout.
* **Reservation Form:** A cleanly designed, centered form for new members to register.
* **Multi-Column Footer:** A 3-column footer containing information about the gym, quick links, and contact info.
* **Layout using Float:** The primary column structure in all page sections was built using the `float` property, relying on a `clear-fix` class to ensure a proper, non-overlapping layout.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** The markup language used for building the page structure.
* **CSS3 (Vanilla):** Used for all styling and layout implementation, with a focus on:
    * `float` & `clear` (for building the layout).
    * Box Model (`margin`, `padding`, `border`).
    * `box-shadow` (for card shadow effects).
    * `border-radius` (for rounded corners).
    * Pseudo-elements (like `::after` in the `clearfix` technique).
